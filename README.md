# MAVs_Pose
This repository contains the official implementation of our paper: **"A Probabilistic Pose Estimation Framework for Micro Aerial Vehicles: Enabling Vision-Based  Aerial Docking"**.

We introduce a novel probabilistic framework for estimating the 3D position and orientation (6-DoF pose) of a Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) from monocular images captured by another aerial vehicle. Our method learns robust 2D-3D keypoint correspondences with inherent 3D awareness, eliminating the need for ground-truth 3D pose data and demonstrating remarkable resilience to self-occlusions.

> **Real-World Validation:** Our model was deployed on an MAV to achieve the **first vision-based autonomous aerial docking with an aircraft carrier**, confirming its practicality for challenging real-world tasks.
